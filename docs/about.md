# About Me

Hey there! I'm Elizabeth (or by my GitHub name, LZBTH16)

I am a driven and passionate computer science student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, game design, and software & web development. With a strong foundation in problem-solving, gained through hands-on experience with challenges in both my studies and work, I am motivated by continuous learning and energized by solving complex technical challenges.

Currently pursuing my third year of studies, I am deepening my knowledge in network systems, software engineering, and Unity-based game development. I am particularly excited about collaborative projects that push creative and technical boundaries while delivering innovative solutions.

Beyond technology, I enjoy Ukrainian dance, piano, cross-stitch, and crochet, all of which cultivate my creativity, discipline, and attention to detail. I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I look forward to applying my skills in a dynamic, real-world setting.
